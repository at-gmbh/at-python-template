## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Placeholder for future updates and new features.
-
## [1.0.1] - 2025-02-26
### Fixed
- **Conda package caching in GitLab CI:** Updated caching paths in `{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/.gitlab-ci.yml` to include the new `.conda` file format and additional cache directories. The updated paths now cache:
  - `$PIP_CACHE_DIR`
  - `$CONDA_PKGS_DIRS/*.conda`
  - `$CONDA_PKGS_DIRS/*.tar.bz2`
  - `$CONDA_PKGS_DIRS/urls*`
  - `$CONDA_PKGS_DIRS/cache`

  This change ensures that all relevant Conda packages and related metadata are properly cached, addressing issues with the previous configuration ([Conda docs](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/configuration/use-condarc.html#force-conda-to-download-only-tar-bz2-packages-use-only-tar-bz2), [Damiankulaâ€™s guide](https://damiankula.com/using_conda_cache_in_gitlabci.html)). cc @ChrsBaur
